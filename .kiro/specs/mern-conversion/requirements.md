# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Convert the existing Taskly application from a traditional server-rendered Express.js application with EJS templates to a modern MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application. The conversion will separate the frontend and backend concerns, creating a RESTful API backend and a React-based single-page application frontend while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **Taskly_System**: The complete task management application
- **API_Server**: The Express.js backend server providing RESTful endpoints
- **React_Client**: The React.js frontend application
- **Authentication_Service**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Task_Entity**: Individual task records with title, due date, priority, description, tags, and status
- **User_Entity**: User accounts with profile information and associated tasks
- **Productivity_Analytics**: Statistical calculations for user task completion metrics

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application through a modern React interface, so that I have a responsive and interactive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE React_Client SHALL render a single-page application with client-side routing
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages, THE React_Client SHALL update the URL without full page refreshes
3. THE React_Client SHALL provide responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
4. THE React_Client SHALL display loading states during API requests
5. THE React_Client SHALL handle and display error messages from the API_Server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a RESTful API backend, so that the frontend and backend are properly separated and the API can be consumed by other clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all user and task operations
2. THE API_Server SHALL return JSON responses for all API endpoints
3. THE API_Server SHALL implement proper HTTP status codes for different response types
4. THE API_Server SHALL validate all incoming request data
5. THE API_Server SHALL handle CORS for cross-origin requests from the React_Client

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate securely, so that my account and tasks are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_Service SHALL use JWT tokens for user authentication
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully, THE Authentication_Service SHALL return a JWT token
3. THE API_Server SHALL validate JWT tokens for protected endpoints
4. THE React_Client SHALL store and include JWT tokens in API requests
5. WHEN a JWT token expires, THE Authentication_Service SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my tasks through the React interface, so that I can create, edit, complete, and delete tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE React_Client SHALL provide forms for creating and editing Task_Entity records
2. THE React_Client SHALL display task lists with filtering and sorting capabilities
3. WHEN a user marks a task as complete, THE React_Client SHALL update the task status immediately
4. THE React_Client SHALL allow users to delete tasks with confirmation dialogs
5. THE React_Client SHALL validate task data before submitting to the API_Server

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my productivity statistics, so that I can track my task completion performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Productivity_Analytics SHALL calculate completion rates, streaks, and average completion times
2. THE React_Client SHALL display productivity statistics in an interactive dashboard
3. THE API_Server SHALL provide endpoints for retrieving productivity analytics
4. THE React_Client SHALL update statistics in real-time when tasks are completed
5. THE Productivity_Analytics SHALL maintain the same calculation logic as the current system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile, so that I can update my personal information and avatar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE React_Client SHALL provide a profile management interface
2. THE API_Server SHALL validate profile updates including email uniqueness
3. WHEN a user updates their profile, THE Authentication_Service SHALL maintain the user session
4. THE React_Client SHALL allow users to change passwords with current password verification
5. THE API_Server SHALL handle avatar uploads and storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view all users, so that I can manage the user base effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE React_Client SHALL display paginated user lists with search functionality
2. THE API_Server SHALL provide endpoints for user management operations
3. THE React_Client SHALL show user statistics and task counts
4. WHEN viewing user details, THE React_Client SHALL display associated tasks and productivity metrics
5. THE API_Server SHALL implement proper authorization for administrative functions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain data consistency, so that the migration preserves all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Server SHALL use the same MongoDB schemas as the current system
2. THE Taskly_System SHALL maintain all existing business logic and validation rules
3. THE API_Server SHALL preserve the task status calculation logic (in-progress, failed, completed)
4. THE React_Client SHALL implement the same user workflows as the current EJS templates
5. THE Taskly_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data
