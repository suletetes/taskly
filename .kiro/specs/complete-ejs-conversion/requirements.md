# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete conversion of all EJS templates and views from the `/views` directory to React components in the `/frontend/src` directory. The conversion must maintain 100% visual and functional parity with the original EJS implementation, ensuring all styling, layouts, interactions, and user experiences remain identical.

## Glossary

- **EJS Template**: Server-side template files with .ejs extension that render HTML with embedded JavaScript
- **React Component**: Client-side JavaScript components that render JSX
- **Visual Parity**: Exact matching of styling, layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive behavior
- **Functional Parity**: Identical user interactions, form behaviors, navigation, and data handling
- **Bootstrap Classes**: CSS framework classes used for styling and layout
- **Component Hierarchy**: The nested structure of React components that replaces EJS includes and layouts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all EJS templates converted to React components, so that the frontend uses a consistent React-based architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all EJS templates are converted, THE React_Frontend SHALL render identical visual output to the EJS templates
2. WHEN users interact with converted pages, THE React_Frontend SHALL provide identical functionality to the EJS implementation
3. WHEN responsive breakpoints are triggered, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical mobile and desktop layouts
4. WHERE Bootstrap classes exist in EJS templates, THE React_Frontend SHALL use identical Bootstrap classes
5. WHILE maintaining visual parity, THE React_Frontend SHALL integrate with existing React services and contexts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the converted pages to look and behave exactly the same, so that my experience is consistent and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the home page, THE React_Frontend SHALL display identical hero sections, quotes, and user listings
2. WHEN navigating between pages, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical header, footer, and navigation styling
3. WHEN viewing user profiles, THE React_Frontend SHALL display identical avatar layouts, stats, and task cards
4. WHEN managing tasks, THE React_Frontend SHALL provide identical forms, buttons, and interaction patterns
5. WHILE using mobile devices, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical responsive behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper component architecture, so that the React frontend is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created, THE React_Frontend SHALL follow proper component hierarchy and separation of concerns
2. WHEN EJS includes are converted, THE React_Frontend SHALL create reusable components for headers, footers, and shared elements
3. WHEN layouts are converted, THE React_Frontend SHALL implement proper routing and layout components
4. WHERE data is displayed, THE React_Frontend SHALL integrate with existing services and state management
5. WHILE maintaining functionality, THE React_Frontend SHALL follow React best practices and patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interactive elements to work identically, so that forms, buttons, and navigation behave as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting forms, THE React_Frontend SHALL handle validation and submission identically to EJS forms
2. WHEN clicking buttons, THE React_Frontend SHALL trigger identical actions and provide identical feedback
3. WHEN using pagination, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical pagination styling and behavior
4. WHEN flash messages appear, THE React_Frontend SHALL display identical notification styling and positioning
5. WHILE interacting with task management features, THE React_Frontend SHALL provide identical CRUD operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all styling to be preserved exactly, so that no visual regressions occur during the conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS classes are applied, THE React_Frontend SHALL use identical Bootstrap and custom CSS classes
2. WHEN images are displayed, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical sizing, positioning, and lazy loading
3. WHEN animations or transitions exist, THE React_Frontend SHALL preserve identical visual effects
4. WHERE custom styling exists, THE React_Frontend SHALL maintain identical custom CSS implementations
5. WHILE ensuring responsiveness, THE React_Frontend SHALL preserve identical breakpoint behaviors
