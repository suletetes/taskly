# Calendar Functionality Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive calendar system in Taskly. The system will provide users with visual calendar views to manage tasks, deadlines, and schedules effectively, replacing the current "Coming Soon" placeholder with a fully functional calendar interface.

## Glossary

- **Calendar_System**: The calendar module within Taskly for viewing and managing tasks by date
- **Task_Calendar**: The main calendar component displaying tasks in monthly, weekly, and daily views
- **Date_Navigator**: The component for navigating between different dates and time periods
- **Task_Scheduler**: The system for creating and editing tasks directly from calendar views
- **Event_Manager**: The component handling calendar events, reminders, and notifications
- **View_Controller**: The system managing different calendar view modes (month, week, day, agenda)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my tasks in a calendar format, so that I can visualize my schedule and manage my time effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the calendar page, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a monthly calendar view with tasks shown on their due dates
2. WHEN tasks exist on a specific date, THE Task_Calendar SHALL display task indicators with priority colors and completion status
3. WHEN a user clicks on a date, THE Calendar_System SHALL show all tasks due on that date in a detailed view
4. WHEN a user hovers over a task indicator, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a tooltip with task title, priority, and due time
5. WHEN the calendar loads, THE Calendar_System SHALL highlight today's date and show current week/month context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different calendar views, so that I can see my tasks at different levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the view selector, THE View_Controller SHALL provide options for month, week, day, and agenda views
2. WHEN a user selects month view, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a full month grid with task indicators on relevant dates
3. WHEN a user selects week view, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a 7-day view with hourly time slots and task scheduling
4. WHEN a user selects day view, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a single day with detailed hourly breakdown and task timeline
5. WHEN a user selects agenda view, THE Calendar_System SHALL display a chronological list of upcoming tasks and deadlines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and edit tasks directly from the calendar, so that I can quickly schedule work without leaving the calendar view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an empty date cell, THE Task_Scheduler SHALL open a quick task creation modal with the selected date pre-filled
2. WHEN a user drags and drops a task to a different date, THE Task_Scheduler SHALL update the task's due date accordingly
3. WHEN a user clicks on an existing task in the calendar, THE Task_Scheduler SHALL open the task edit modal with current details
4. WHEN a user creates a task from the calendar, THE Task_Scheduler SHALL save the task and immediately display it on the calendar
5. WHERE a user has appropriate permissions, THE Task_Scheduler SHALL allow editing of task details directly from calendar context menus

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate easily between different time periods, so that I can view past and future schedules efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks navigation arrows, THE Date_Navigator SHALL move to the previous or next time period based on current view
2. WHEN a user clicks "Today" button, THE Date_Navigator SHALL return to the current date in the active view mode
3. WHEN a user clicks on month/year header, THE Date_Navigator SHALL display a date picker for quick navigation to any date
4. WHEN a user uses keyboard shortcuts, THE Date_Navigator SHALL respond to arrow keys and common navigation shortcuts
5. WHEN navigating between periods, THE Calendar_System SHALL maintain the selected view mode and load relevant task data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual indicators for different task types and statuses, so that I can quickly understand my schedule at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are displayed on the calendar, THE Calendar_System SHALL use different colors to indicate task priority levels
2. WHEN tasks have different statuses, THE Calendar_System SHALL display appropriate visual indicators for completed, in-progress, and overdue tasks
3. WHEN multiple tasks exist on the same date, THE Calendar_System SHALL stack or group task indicators appropriately
4. WHEN tasks have tags or categories, THE Calendar_System SHALL display category indicators alongside priority colors
5. WHEN tasks are recurring, THE Calendar_System SHALL show recurring task indicators and patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive calendar-based notifications and reminders, so that I don't miss important deadlines and appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task deadline approaches, THE Event_Manager SHALL send notifications based on user-configured reminder settings
2. WHEN a user has tasks due today, THE Calendar_System SHALL highlight today's date with a special indicator showing task count
3. WHEN overdue tasks exist, THE Calendar_System SHALL display overdue indicators and provide quick access to overdue task management
4. WHEN a user sets custom reminders, THE Event_Manager SHALL schedule and deliver notifications at the specified times
5. WHERE notification preferences are configured, THE Event_Manager SHALL respect user settings for notification frequency and delivery method

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to integrate calendar functionality with existing task management features, so that I have a seamless workflow between different views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task from any part of the application, THE Calendar_System SHALL immediately reflect the new task on the appropriate calendar date
2. WHEN a user updates a task's due date, THE Calendar_System SHALL move the task indicator to the new date automatically
3. WHEN a user completes a task, THE Calendar_System SHALL update the visual indicator to show completion status
4. WHEN a user filters tasks in other views, THE Calendar_System SHALL apply the same filters to calendar display
5. WHEN a user accesses task details from the calendar, THE Calendar_System SHALL provide the same functionality as other task views
