# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the migration of CSS styling and static assets from the old EJS-based frontend to the new React frontend, and the organization of remaining root-level files into their appropriate backend/frontend directories.

## Glossary

- **Legacy Frontend**: The original EJS-based frontend located in the `/views` directory
- **React Frontend**: The new React-based frontend located in the `/frontend` directory  
- **Static Assets**: CSS files, images, fonts, and JavaScript files in the `/public` directory
- **Root Files**: Files and directories currently at the project root that need to be organized
- **Backend Directory**: The `/backend` directory containing the Express API server
- **Frontend Directory**: The `/frontend` directory containing the React application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to transfer all CSS styling from the legacy frontend to the React frontend, so that the new application maintains the same visual design and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE System SHALL adapt Bootstrap and custom CSS classes to work with React components
3. THE System SHALL preserve all existing styling for login, signup, task management, and user profile pages
4. THE System SHALL ensure responsive design works correctly in the React application
5. THE System SHALL maintain all hover effects, transitions, and interactive styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to transfer all static assets to the React frontend, so that images, fonts, and other resources are properly served.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL copy all image files from `/public/img/` to the React frontend public directory
2. THE System SHALL copy all font files from `/public/fonts/` to the React frontend public directory
3. THE System SHALL update all asset references to use the correct paths in React
4. THE System SHALL preserve image optimization and lazy loading functionality
5. THE System SHALL maintain favicon and other meta assets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize root-level files into appropriate directories, so that the project structure is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL move backend-related files from root to `/backend` directory
2. THE System SHALL move frontend-related files from root to `/frontend` directory  
3. THE System SHALL delete obsolete EJS views and related files from root
4. THE System SHALL update import paths and references after file moves
5. THE System SHALL preserve functionality after reorganization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up obsolete files and directories, so that the project only contains necessary files for the MERN stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL remove the `/views` directory and all EJS templates
2. THE System SHALL remove obsolete middleware and route files from root
3. THE System SHALL remove old Express app configuration files from root
4. THE System SHALL preserve only files needed for the new architecture
5. THE System SHALL update documentation to reflect new structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all styling works correctly in React components, so that the application looks and behaves as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL test all CSS classes work with React JSX syntax
2. THE System SHALL verify responsive breakpoints function correctly
3. THE System SHALL ensure form validation styling displays properly
4. THE System SHALL confirm navigation and layout components render correctly
